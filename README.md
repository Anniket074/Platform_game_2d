# Platform_game_2d
One of my initial game for learning basics of game development
Game : Running Saga
The aim of this game is help Mr. Hopper to reach the finish flag with atleast coins of worth 125 , then only you can go to the next level.
There are three types of coins with different values :
i) Bronze - 5 , ii) Silver - 10, iii) Gold - 20 
And While travelling over terrains you have to save Mr. Hopper from the trap.

By making this game, I learned about making 2d terrain, player control and UI button development. And some methods of C# scripts.

Hope You like my game. :)
